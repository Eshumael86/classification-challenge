# Email Filtering System Improvement

## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the email filtering system of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) by developing a supervised machine learning (ML) model to accurately detect and filter spam emails. Two classification models will be implemented and evaluated to determine the most effective solution:

1. Logistic Regression Model
2. Random Forest Model

The goal is to improve customer satisfaction by reducing the amount of spam emails that reach their inboxes.

## Dataset Description
The provided dataset contains labeled email data with the following characteristics:
- **Features**: Various attributes extracted from email content (e.g., word frequency, special characters, etc.).
- **Target Variable**: 
  - `1`: Spam email
  - `0`: Not spam email

---

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning**: Remove missing values and irrelevant features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features (e.g., presence of certain keywords, length of the email, sender information).
- **Normalization**: Scale numeric features for the logistic regression model.
- **Splitting**: Divide the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80%-20%).

### 2. Model Development
#### Logistic Regression Model
- A simple yet effective linear model used for binary classification.
- Strengths: Interpretable, computationally efficient.
- Implementation: Train the model on the training dataset and tune hyperparameters as needed.

#### Random Forest Model
- An ensemble-based model that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their outputs.
- Strengths: Handles complex, non-linear relationships, and reduces overfitting through bagging.
- Implementation: Train the model and tune hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, max depth).

### 3. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of both models on the test dataset using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Ability to identify only spam emails correctly.
- **Recall**: Ability to identify all spam emails.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the models.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations.
  - `scikit-learn`: Model implementation and evaluation.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization.

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify the more accurate model for spam email detection.
- Provide recommendations on integrating the chosen model into the ISPâ€™s existing email filtering system.
- Document insights and performance differences between logistic regression and random forest models.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with additional models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Gradient Boosting.
- Incorporate advanced feature extraction techniques (e.g., Natural Language Processing methods).
- Explore semi-supervised or unsupervised learning to handle unlabeled email data.
